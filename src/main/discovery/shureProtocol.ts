 * text and routinely has spaces in it — "Lead Vox", "Pastor 1", "Radio 2". A

 * "Vox"→"BATT_CHARGE", "078"→"RF_LVL_A". BATT_CHARGE then looked absent, the
 * carry-over kept the previous value, and the battery gauge froze — which on a
 * radio-mic monitor is the worst available way for this to fail.
 *
 * Two forms are handled. Braces are the protocol's own delimiter and exist
 * precisely because the value can contain spaces (ULX-D/QLX-D/Axient send
 * `CHAN_NAME {Lead Vox            }`); the padding inside is stripped. Without
 * braces, a value runs until the next token that is a known key.
